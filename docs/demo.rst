This section highlights real-world demonstrations of how Saline SDK enables powerful asset protection through programmable mandates.
Each demo includes:

‚Ä¢ A clear use case

‚Ä¢ A YouTube walkthrough

‚Ä¢ GitHub code for replication

.. note::
These examples go beyond basic scripts. They showcase how Saline protects assets from AI hallucinated or rogue agents, matchers, or bots, ensuring safe automation on and across chains.

.. _demo_block_asset:

Block Assets from Agent
=========================

Block Assets from Being Used by Agent

Purpose:
Prevent an unauthorized matcher/agent from touching user assets‚Äîeven if it submits a valid-looking transaction.

üíª Code: `GitHub Source <https://github.com/risingsealabs/saline-sdk/blob/main/demo/whitelist-agents>`_

Scenario:

    ‚Ä¢ User A installs a mandates that restrcit its BTC balance to only stay above 3 

    ‚Ä¢ Matcher A attempts to transfer 1 BTC ‚Üí ‚ùå REJECTED

    ‚Ä¢ Matcher A transfers 2 ETH ‚Üí ‚úÖ ACCEPTED

Insight:
Even if the matcher is allowed to interact generally, fine-grained mandates on assets can override it.



.. _demo_whitelist_agents:

Only Allow Interaction with Whitelisted Agents
=========================

Only Allow Interaction with Whitelisted Agents

Purpose:
Only trusted agents/LLMs should be allowed to interact with your wallet.

           title="Only allow interaction with whitelist Agent/Matcher (SDK)" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


üíª Code: `GitHub Source <https://github.com/risingsealabs/saline-sdk/blob/main/demo/whitelist-agents>`_

Scenario:

    ‚Ä¢ User B creates a mandate that whitelists only Matcher/Agent XYZ.

    ‚Ä¢ Agent XYZ transfers ETH/BTC from User B address  ‚Üí ‚úÖ ACCEPTED

    ‚Ä¢ Any other agent attempt to transfer asset from User B ‚Üí ‚ùå REJECTED

Insight:
Whitelisting agents gives users powerful filters for automation and delegation.



.. _demo_swap_conditions:

Conditional Swap, Whitelist and Time-frame
=========================

Conditional Swap: 1 BTC for >= 20 ETH + Only With ABC Agent + Allow once

Purpose:
Showcase conditional, chained logic for automated swaps.

           title="Complex Multi-Layer rules for agent interaction (SDK)" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

üíª Code: `GitHub Source <https://github.com/risingsealabs/saline-sdk/blob/main/demo/swap_whitelist_timeframe>`_

Scenario:

    ‚Ä¢ User C creates an intent: "Only swap 1 BTC for ETH >= 20, agent must be ABC and allow once"

    ‚Ä¢ Matcher ABC proposes 2 BTC ‚Üí ‚ùå REJECTED
    
    ‚Ä¢ Matcher XYZ proposes 1 BTC for 20 ETH ‚Üí ‚ùå REJECTED

    ‚Ä¢ Matcher ABC proposes 1 BTC for 20 ETH ‚Üí ‚úÖ ACCEPTED

Insight:
Saline lets you specify not just what to trade, but under what logic, with whom and how many time .

.. _demo_mcp_guard:
LLM Agent With Mandate Awareness (MCP)
=========================

Purpose:
Demonstrate how a language model connected via MCP can understand and respect user mandates.

.. raw:: html

   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3MJu-eW6Rc" 
           title="Submit transaction through LLM with MCP using mandates" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

üíª Code: `GitHub Source <https://github.com/risingsealabs/saline-sdk/blob/main/demo/mcp_transactions>`_

Scenario:

    ‚Ä¢ User D sets a mandate: "BTC balance must stay >= 2 BTC"

    ‚Ä¢ LLM Agent attempts 1 BTC transfer ‚Üí ‚ùå REJECTED

    ‚Ä¢ LLM Agent attempts 2 ETH transfer ‚Üí ‚úÖ ACCEPTED

Insight:
Saline makes mandates legible to agents‚Äîenabling verifiable AI compliance.

.. _demo_mcp_swap_matcher:

LLM Matcher market-making with MCP
=========================

LLM Matcher: Discover + Submit Matching Swaps (MCP)

Purpose:
Show how an LLM can act as a decentralized market maker by reading intents, finding matches, and submitting a transaction.

.. raw:: html

   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCRNxDLHXDI" 
           title="Market making intents through LLM with MCP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

üíª Code: `GitHub Source <https://github.com/risingsealabs/saline-sdk/blob/main/demo/mcp_marketmaking>`_
Scenario:

    ‚Ä¢ LLM queries all swap intents on-chain

    ‚Ä¢ Finds compatible pairs

    ‚Ä¢ Submits atomic transaction to execute both sides

Insight:
This is decentralized, intelligent market-making. No smart contract needed. Just logic and trustless coordination.
